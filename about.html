                <h2>How to move a piece?</h2>
                <p>There are 16 pieces per player. Initially, the location of the pieces was unknown.
                    You should open the unknown pieces. You can move one of your pieces up, down right and
                    left one by one step. If a tiger or lynx is in a forest, you can place it anywhere 
                    in the forest that is not obstructed. If a lion or leopard is on a grassland, you can place 
                    it anywhere on the grassland that is not obstructed. If a dog, cat or mouse in a residential, 
                    it can be placed anywhere in the residential that is not obstructed. Especially, a mouse can wander 
                    anywhere in the desert that is not obstructed if it is located in the desert. Be careful of swamps, 
                    if you place one of your pieces in a swamp, there is a 1/3 chance that you will lose the piece.</p>
